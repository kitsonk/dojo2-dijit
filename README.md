# dojo2-dijit

An example package of integrating Dojo 1 Dijit's into a Dojo 2 application.

## Usage

First clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kitsonk/dojo2-dijit.git
```

Then perform an install:

```
$ npm install
```

Then perform a build:

```
$ npm run build
```

This requires a locally hosted web server.  At this point navigating to the root of the package should launch the application.  For example if you have a webserver on port `8080` serving the parent directory of the package as a root, navigating to `http://localhost:8080/dojo2-dijit/` should load the application.
